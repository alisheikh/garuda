v3.0.5: March 2014
==================

* Build against Metrics-core 3.0.2.
* Build against Akka 2.1.4, 2.2.4 and 2.3.0.
* Small documentations correction (thanks @oschrenk!)
* Fixed description in pom.

v3.0.4: December 2013

v3.0.3_a2.1.0: September 2013
=============================

* Same release build against Akka 2.1.0 instead of 2.2.0.

v3.0.3: August 2013
===================

* Added support for health checks (thanks @scullxbones), [#17](https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issue/17). The module metrics-healthchecks is now a required dependency.

v3.0.2: August 2013
===================

* added back inc/dec on Counter (thanks @alexy), [#14](https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issue/14)
* Renamed `Timer.time` for partial functions to prevent type annotations (thanks @scullxbones), [#13](https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issue/13), [#15](https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issue/15).
* Renamed `Meter.exceptionMarkerPartialFunction` to `Meter.exceptionMarkerPF` to be consistent with `Timer`.

v3.0.1: August 2013
===================

* Upgrade to Metrics-core 3.0.1, [#10](https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issue/10).
* Added support for partial functions (thanks @scullxbones).
* Added support for actors and futures (scala 2.10 only) for timing and metering exceptions (thanks @scullxbones), [#8](https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issue/8).
* Removes '$' from metrics names, [#11](https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issue/11).


v3.0.0: June 2013
=================

* As code is no longer maintained by Coda Hale, added and updated copyright statements to reflect this.
* Depends on Metrics-core 3.0.0.
* Ported tests from original to ScalaTest (thanks @scullxbones).
* Added documentation.

Although the metrics-scala API is mostly source compatible, there are breaking API changes
which are mostly caused by changes in the metrics-core library:

* All code moved to the `nl.grons.metrics.scala` package (changed at Coda Hale's request).
* All timers now measure in nanoseconds.
* All configuration for histograms, meters, and timers are gone. These are now configured in the reporter.
* The class `Instrumented` must now be created in your project by extending `InstrumentedBuilder`.
* Dropped method `clear` on `Histogram` and `Timer`.

Up to v2.2.0
============

* No code changes.


v2.1.2: Sep 10 2012
===================

* Initial copy from Coda Hale's Metrics project.
